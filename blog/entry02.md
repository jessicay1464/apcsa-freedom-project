### EDP (Engineering Design Process)
In this process, we are now in step 2 of the engineering design process where we **Researching the Problem**. In this case, we are using every Monday to learn our tool that we chose. For instance, we tinker, watch tutorials, take = notes in our `learning-log.md` as a guide to help us go through our process and learn the process. In the past step, we found out what tool we want to use through our project and what we can make out of the project and at the same time, we can corporate and connect how we can use tool and using the tool to create a project that we want. In this case, I chose Python/Django. Since this is a whole new process when we are learning our tool that can help us later on build our project in the Spring. This was a diffcult process because there were many parts of the code that I didn't really understand. But something that helped me was to watch tutorials going online and breaking down the parts and writing comments as we go through the process had helped me a lot.
