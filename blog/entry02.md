### Skills
During these few weeks of learning my tool, I had learned a lot, but at the same time, I have thought how the code that I have been recently learning will be a great way that I can use to corporate it into my project later on. Well, throughout these weeks of tinkering, I have achieved in learning the different skills. For instance, **Organization** and **Attention to Detail**. First of all, I chose Organization because what do we do with all the learning that we learn about our tool. Of course, we should put it into our `learning-log.md`. This was greatly helpful because in the past, we put the code into the SEP 10 and or 11 google docs. This was benefical because in `github`, we can just use backticks. This can help us by just typing in the backticks and that helped us organized the code but also put our links in one big safe space. Another example would be Attention to Detail because in the Python System, some codes are different in Python, such as `//`. This is what we use in Java and Javascript, but in this case, we use `#` and that this had brought me lots of error while running the code. This is why I say **Organization** and **Attention to Detail**.

### EDP (Engineering Design Process)
In this process, we are now in step 2 of the engineering design process where we **Researching the Problem**. In this case, we are using every Monday to learn our tool that we chose. For instance, we tinker, watch tutorials, take = notes in our `learning-log.md` as a guide to help us go through our process and learn the process. In the past step, we found out what tool we want to use through our project and what we can make out of the project and at the same time, we can corporate and connect how we can use tool and using the tool to create a project that we want. In this case, I chose Python/Django. Since this is a whole new process when we are learning our tool that can help us later on build our project in the Spring. This was a diffcult process because there were many parts of the code that I didn't really understand. But something that helped me was to watch tutorials going online and breaking down the parts and writing comments as we go through the process had helped me a lot.
