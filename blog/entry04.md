### How have I been learning my tool?

### How have we been building our MVP?
 * When stating on how I have been learning my MVP 

### EDP (Software Engineering Process)
 * I am currently in the pace of `Step 3: Brainstorm possible solutions`, `Step 4: Planning the Most Promising solution` and also the `Step 5: Create a Prototype`. First of all, I say that we are Brainstorming possible solutions because we are learning the outcomes that we can make using python and my tool that help me build out our freedom project. This is because we have different scenes. Leading that, my partner and I build out the different versions of the game on paper first because we believe that on paper, we can visually see how we will be making the project. Furthermore, this bring us to the planning the most promising solution in a way that we have been linking out what we will be doing every single day. In this process, we have overcome some challenges such as sometimes, the code will not work as expected. Also, I would like to say somedays, we might not be able to finish the what we wanted on time. After planning out what our project will be like, we would need to start making the prototype, our project. In this case, we are taking a step now to finish all the sprites that will be appearing in the game. All three of these processes are combined in this case because building, but in some parts that I wasn't able to cover, I still had to learn on some parts of the code to help me further more understand and help my project

### Skills
 * Two skills that I have been learning with my project is `Organization` but also `How to Google`. For instance, I would say Organization because with the correct organization, our project will be organized that can help me and my partner understand the process more easily. This is because we both are visual learners, and being organized can help us structure our minds much more easily. In addition, Angela has also helped me created a repo that has also helped us a lot by making sure that all the documents are in the correct area, but also adding in file in the correct folder. This had helped us a lot too. At the same time, I would say How to Google because the use of google had helped me with my tool and is a very cool way to help me in giving me ideas and finding sources that can help me such as videos and documentaries. Moreover, after learning my tool, I was somewhat confused in a way that I didn't know how I can use my tool for the project. As I mentioned above, I asked Mr.Mueller on the different tools that later helped me dive into the different more tools that helped me with the outcome I would want. Later on, when we want to learn more about each tool, I have also find a lot of sources from Google to help me. Overall, this is why I would convey that the skills that we have learned is `Organization` and `How to Google`.
