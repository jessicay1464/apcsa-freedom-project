### How have I built my MVP?


### How I have been learning my tool?


### Skills
Skills that I have accomplished when completing the building of the structure of MVP were time management, problem decomposition and communitcation. For instance, the first skill that I have accomplished was time-management because we have spent so much time building, but also there were also days where i procrastinate a lot and that is not good. Therefore, during the spring break, I was able to make an scehdule for myself and work on the seperate parts and work on them for each day. This had greatly helped me turn in the work on time, but being able to spend time on the parts equallly in time. At the same time, I would also say problem decomposition because while creating my MVP/prototype, there are still many concepts that I still have not been very familiar and I would have to slowly break down the problem that I have so far and research the issue that I have so far and fix the conflict. Next, was communication because I have a partner and that I have communicated with her in working on the connection of our project and how we can make that work. I have also communicated with another group with DJango that helped me answer the question how I run the server with Django. 

### EDP (Engineering Design Process)
Currently, I am in the middle of the Steps 3, 4, 5. These are considered as `Researching the problem, Planning the most promising solution, Creating a prototype`. First of all, I say I was still researching the problem because I was creating the prototype, my MVP, I was still looking up the issues that I was having in Python and Django, researching the tiny issues that I had missed out accidentally that can help me throughout the process of building up my code. This is also a process that I have still been learning my code. Also, I also added in planning the most promising solution because me and my partner Angela, was also making a planning out on paper such as how we want the character to look like on how out project would look like. Lastly, I was also saying creating a prototype because this time, we are in the process of creating a MVP, the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This was a part of me and my partner in the process of making a product or the prototype.
