### Content (How I have been learning about my tool)
Throughout these weeks of tinkering

### What is my plan for the Spring Break?

### Skills
 * `How to Google`
 * `Problem Decomposition`
 * Two skills that I have accomplished while tinkering in these few weeks of tinkering will be `How to Google` and `Problem Decomposition` because in these cases, I was able to use Google, as a tool to help me understand and learn the tool. In some cases, when I look through some parts of the code, I have met some misunderstandings and difficulties
