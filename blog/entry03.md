### Content (How I have been learning about my tool)
Throughout these weeks of tinkering

### What is my plan for the Spring Break?

### Skills
 * Two skills that I have accomplished while tinkering in these few weeks of tinkering will be `How to Google` and `Problem Decomposition` because in these cases, I was able to use Google, as a tool to help me understand and learn the tool. In some cases, when I look through some parts of the code, I have met some misunderstandings and difficulties. With the help of Google, I was able to continue with my journey with Python and finding out how we can continue with my project with the connection of python through the videos and webpages such as [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/). To add on, I would also say Problem Decomposition because although I was able to use Python to print out the words that I wanted, I found out that it was really difficult to create into a webpage due to the reason that it was really more in common to backend of the code and more making the webpage more visually appearing. However, linking it back to the other skill that I have accomplished in on being able to How to Google, I was able to use Google to help me discovered the other platform and was `Flask` that I can also use to help me create my webpage. Overall, being able to `How to Google` was a skill that I have achieved that I was able to use in `Problem Decompositioning`.

### EDP
During these few weeks of tinkering our tool and processing, I can say that we are still in the process of `Researching the Problem` but at the same time, moving ourselves into the Step 3 and that is to `Brainstorm Possible Solutions`. For instance, we have been tinkering and learning with our tools and being more into a deep understanding of how to use and how we can incorporate that into our project in the future. Furthermore, I have been learning how use Python but also learning how to use Flask to help me in the designs of the webpage. On the other hand, my partner, Angela and I have been planning out and thinking how on how we would want our project to look like and incorporating how we can make the project the way we want. But also, we have also started to draw the sprites that we want to use to make the project after a few weeks.
