I have decided on my tool on **Python/Django**. I have decided on my tool on Python/Django because, I am creating a website that includes a game for users to learn with my partner, Angela and she is creating the game with plain Javascript and I am creating a interactive website that introduces users to the idea of plain Javascript and have a basic knowledge of the idea of what plain Javascript is and that teaches them to program websites with and this is why I chose my tool Python, DJango to create a website to put together the information and the website for Plain Javascipt and use my website to help knowledge one another. But also, last year in our freedom project, we also spent time learning `Kaboom` to help us create an adventure game. That now, we would want to create something similar but also that it can be more challenging. Therefore, I chose Python/DJango. Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is also mainly designed documents that emphasizes code readability with the use of **indentation**, so that this means that we don't need to use curly brackets in our code, instead, we should use indentations as a way to use it as a way of curly brackets (`indentations == function of curly brackets`). Moreover, Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the main skeleton of web development. This can mainly help me with the interactive website that I am currently tinkering and working with.<br>

**To Tinker with my tool**<br>
I have done many different activities that makes me feel more passionate with what I want to create with my tool. To learn my code, I have started with watching a tutorial with Mr. Mosh that introduced me with my tool Python/Django and that I am really passionate about it. Overall, when looking through the videos, it was very difficult to understand. For instance, in this video, I learned about how to import documentations that I have tried to learn on my end, however, there were still some errors that I have overcome that I still need to fix such as downloading the program into my server because as how Mr. Mosh introduce it, there are multiple ways to create import such as including the importing link, but also using the terminal to use the terminal to download Python/Django into `Github`. While watching the tutorial, I have gathered the information and tried to follow the steps on installing this into my [Github](github.com). 

**Steps** to import documentations<br>
 1) create a folder `storefront`<br>
 2) go inside the folder<br>
 3) `pipenv install django`<br>
 4) `django-admin`- to start a new project<br>

However, while I was doing this step, I was also having issue with using `python-admin`, because there were multiple issues that I have overcome because the intense and the varieties of vocabularys and the different functions and understanding what each code do, such as `run-server`, `load data`, `changing data`, `shell`...`etc`. Therefore, I also went into DJango formal website to learn through reading the documentations and learned how to install DJango into my browser, but using `from django.db import models`. But I was way more curious of how I can imply what I need in my tool to create what I want for my project. Next up, I went to w3schools (link below) to help me learn the basics of code and to accomplish some exercises what was beneficial for me such as learning the `models`
```python
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
```
In this part of the code, the `first_name` and `last_name` are known as the fields of this model. This means that the user can only input a word that is at max 30 letters. This model is based of the call of the class `Person`. As we can also see, when we declare a new `var`, we don't need datatypes, however there are. And this would be my next steps in defining the different `types of variable` but also what is the difference between a variable declared and not declared.<br>
I also learned about the different variables and syntaxs. Moreover, learning new a new computer-based language that is different from what we learn about `Javascript` and `Java`. From here, I learned about the basics of my code. For instance, when we want to comment out, we should use `#`. But also I learned that, in Python, we don't actually need the `variables` declared (although there are still different datatypes, as I went through the website and the exercises.

### EDP (Engineering Design Process)
Currently, we are at the design process of **#1 Defining the problem.** Well, this year in APCSA, we aren't actually having a problem, but we are able to create the project that we are passionate about that we would want to learn and create with it. We were able to use the tools that we learn and tinker with to help us correspond with the topic that best fits us in advance. At first, I was thinking is using `Python/Django` and I did research about it. After that day, I was very confirmed with my tool that, I would want to use `Python/DJango` to help us create this interactive wesbite to help and inspire people into plain Javascript and using it to program my Freedom Project.

### Skills 
Two main skills that I have overcame when I was tinkering and choosing my tool are `How to Read` and `Time Management`. At first, I would say `How to Read` because we would have to read through multiple documents and watch videos. In this case, `How to Read` would come to a huge role because we would have to be careful about what we are reading, making sure that we jot down notes that are important to us. But also, we can also learn baout the different parts and piece of code that we can throw into our `sandbox` and just freely tinker with it. This can help us make sure that we are learning different concepts. Also, I would say the idea of `Time Management` would also be very important because it is serious and important that we tinker our tool and updating our `leanring-log`, although we may be busy with other school work and the applications for college. This would be a huge mess if we didn't balance everything out. Therefore, I would say that `Time Management` would also be important. Overall, these are the two skills that I have accomplish when tinkering and choosing my tool.<br>
