I have decided on my tool on **Python/Django**. I have decided on my tool on Python/Django because, I am creating a website that includes a game for users to learn with my partner, Angela and she is creating the game with plain Javascript and I am creating a interactive website that introduces users to the idea of plain Javascript and have a basic knowledge of the idea of what plain Javascript is and that teaches them to program websites with and this is why I chose my tool Python, DJango to create a website to put together the information and the website for Plain Javascipt and use my website to help knowledge one another. Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is also mainly designed documents that emphasizes code readability with the use of **indentation**, so that this means that we don't need to use curly brackets in our code, instead, we should use indentations as a way to use it as a way of curly brackets (`indentations == function of curly brackets`). Moreover, Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the main skeleton of web development. This can mainly help me with the interactive website that I am currently tinkering and working with.<br>
**To Tinker with my tool**<br>
I have done many different activities that makes me feel more passionate with what I want to create with my tool. To learn my code, I have started with watching a tutorial with Mr. Mosh that introduced me with my tool Python/Django and that I am really passionate about it. Overall, when looking through the videos, it was very difficult to understand. For instance, in this video, I learned about how to import documentations that I have tried to learn on my end, however, there were still some errors that I have overcome that I still need to fix such as downloading the program into my server because as how Mr. Mosh introduce it, there are multiple ways to create import such as including the importing link, but also using the terminal to use the terminal to download Python/Django into `Github`. While watching the tutorial, I have gathered the information and tried to follow the steps on installing this into my [Github](github.com). 

**Steps** to import documentations<br>
 1) create a folder `storefront`<br>
 2) go inside the folder<br>
 3) `pipenv install django`<br>
 4) `django-admin`- to start a new project<br>

However, while I was doing this step, I was also having issue with using admin, because there were multiple issues that I have overcome because the intense and the varieties of vocabs and the different functions and understanding what each code do, such as `run-server`, `load data`, `changing data`, `shell`...etc. Therefore, I also went into DJango formal website to learn through reading the documentations and learned how to install DJango into my browser, but using `from django.db import models`. But I was way more curious of how I can imply what I need in my tool to create what I want for my project. Next up, I went to w3schools to help me learn the basics of code and to accomplish some exercises what was beneficial for me. From here, I learned about the basics of my code and the similarities and differences to Java, what we learned in class. In Java, it was very important to what we need
