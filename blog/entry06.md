### Takeaways from expo elevator pitch
It was time to present in the cafeteria. After we are done creating our MVP and our beyond MVP, we had ewnt for an expo fair presentation. For the expo fair, this is the shorter version of our whole presentation, and the whole process was around 2 minutes. 

We started off with our [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13nAkl3cmet4if7_nf5XDTuvOgY8a4ScrjTcHTHKiVOs/edit?usp=sharing), that we drafted in google docs. In this elevator pitch, we needed a speech that was 1 to a minute and a half minutes. My partner, Angela and I had divided the work up. So for Angela's work, she did the greeting, what the project is about, the purpose of the project, and how to use the project. Since this year, me and Angela has different types of tools, we separated our speech more by explaining how we used our tool for our project. I explained how to use our game sucha s how "Our game functions by using the AWSD keys to interact with the sprite and navigate through the map." To add on, we also explained the concepts and inspiration such as how we have drawn our sprites based on our SEP class and the concept. To help the interactions between the web pages more easily to nagivate, we imported a button that can benefit the user. Finally, I explained about our next steps by adding chats and more features in the game such as animation when attacking, to help connect the users no matter where we are around the world. To make sure that our presentations was in the time limit, we had to deleted some lines, and made sure that it made sense and the same time, explained our basic process of the project so then we can also leave some time for the judges to ask questions prior to our project. Since we were in closer to the beginning of our project, it was very scary and nervous, especially that when we are done with our words, we needed to answer questions from judges, and I believe this was the hardest because we also need to consider our game in the practibility and usability more and how it benefit the world around us and I think this is where we messed up on.  

### In class presentations
Well, this year in APCSA was one of my best presentations that I have made throughout my four years in high school. This is slightly different than what we do in the expo. In our in class presentation, we had to make sure that for our presentation, we had to make sure that it was in between the time range of 3 to 10 minutes. My partner and I created the slides together. In total, we made 19 sildes. In this presentation, this is where I closely explain our process such as intro, hook, demo, timeline, tools, mockups/planning, MVP, beyond MVP, challenges, and takeaways. So for our
