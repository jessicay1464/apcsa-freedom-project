* [Link](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/) to the intro of documentations of how I can import Django to my browser.
* [Link](https://youtu.be/rHux0gMZ3Eg?si=eNJpyaKKprEuYUhT) to introduce me to the purpose of Django and what it is mainly used for.
 * Django is a free and open source framework for building web apps with Python.
 * There are two sides of the program that one side is the client page and one is the server page, and that the client is needed to request the page, while the server will later to return the page.
 **Steps** to import documentations<br>
 1) create a folder `storefront`<br>
 2) go inside the folder<br>
 3) `pipenv install django`<br>
 4) `django-admin`- to start a new project<br>

 I learned that even though you deleted the folder for your project, when we use `django-admin startproject projectName .`, we are able to create a project in our own directory right now. When you don't have a project inside your server or nothing inside the setting inside your project, when you run your server, it can cause multiple errors.
  * When you run `python manage.py runserver`, you are able to get a list of different next steps that you can run inside the server, such as `run-server`, `load data`, `changing data`, `shell`...etc.<br>

Challenges: There are folders and files that contain the same name, that makes it confusing to which file we are editing in and how we can solve this issue.<br>
