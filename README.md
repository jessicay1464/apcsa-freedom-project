# APCSA Freedom Project
by **Jessica Yang**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for AP Computer Science A is a year-long project all about making anything using technology and programming library that help us in creating our prototype. To add on, throughout the year, we were to choose a tool and learn it through tinkering, watching tutorials, and reading documentaries to help create a prototype throughout the year, known as the Year Long Project. It can be a game, or anything that is consist of using these ideas and tools. In APCSA, we weren't limited, but we were able to do anything that we were passionate in. In addition, when we are finally done learning, we were able to use what we learn and combine them to make the product through the process of building an MVP and beyond MVP. The purpose of writing blogs is to jot down my process while doing each part of making our project. For instance, my challenges, my a-ha moments, or even some content that we learn. When going through each process of our project, we were to write a blog that is a way to help students process out what they are doing and what their challenges are.

For creating my project, me and my partner Angela created a RPG game that has the theme of attacking the sprite that is inspired by our APCSA class, such as classmates, Mr.Mueller, and APCSA concepts. In this game, we basically used the tool Python/DJango, HTML, CSS, and plain Javascript. These tools helped us created games and the instructions page. To choose our game, the Cooking Tuesday, it had help us create a game or any product that uses most content that we learn throughout the year and using the tools that we chose to assist us making our game and prototype. In this game, we drew sprites, load them, and placed them in an appropriate location of the game. We were also to design our game map that the game was to be hold in, and this included the movement of the sprite, but also spawning of the sprites. Mainly, to connected our prototypes together, we were to use a button to help make the transformation of the page more easy for the user.

* Individuals can get addicted to games and that affects their personal responsibilities, mental health, and personalities.
* Infrastructures and business can have less people apply for job after being acknowledge about the risks in the game field.
